# TSPTW
A General VNS heuristic for the traveling salesman problem with time windows.

# Abstract
The heuristic is composed by both constructive and optimization stages. In the first stage, the heuristic constructs
a feasible solution using VNS, and in the optimization stage the heuristic improves the feasible solution with a General VNS heuristic. Both constructive and optimization stages take advantage of elimination tests, partial neighbor evaluation and neighborhood
partitioning techniques.
